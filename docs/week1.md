## Security

In minimum, addressing the five bolded web application security risks needs to be reported
weekly by each group. Extra points available for further consideration of the other risks.
https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/

1. **Injection**
    - no user input yet to the web application
    - user supplied data is not used in any way 
    - handling the '/' route with static response 
    - other requested resources return a default 404 page.

2. Broken authentication
3. **Sensitive data exposure**
    - app uses http but doesn't currently use sensitive data
    - app user can't access files directly from the server
    - app doesn't store passwords, app keys, secrets etc.

4. XML External Entities (XXE)
5. Broken access control
6. **Security misconfiguration**
    - using default static error pages that shouldn't contain stack traces etc.
    - using recent versions of the tools used
      - python 3.8 used in app engine
      - flask 1.1.x
    - access control as specified in the lectures


7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
8. Insecure Deserialization
9. **Using components with known vulnerabilities**
    - no unnecessary dependencies
    - used popular components from trusted sources or managed by google cloud with no known vulnerabilities related to our app

10. **Insufficient logging & monitoring**
    - using google cloud platform logging and monitoring utilities
